In this the use of deep learning for predicting the resemblance of a child's face to their father or mother is done. 

Using the DeepFace package for Python, a pre-trained facial recognition model is leveraged to extract facial features and compute similarity scores between parent and child images. 

Model was designed to predict family resemblances.
